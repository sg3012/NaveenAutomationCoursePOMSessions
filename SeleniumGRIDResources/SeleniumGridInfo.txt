---> Selenium Grid is not a programming language or tool or a component, it is just a concept for setting/designing
remote execution environment.

---> What is the default password for Selenium Grid sessions?
Ans: The password is "secret"
---> On which port does Selenium hub runs on by default?
 Ans: 4444
 
 ---> Every Selenium Grid node along with the hub need a different machine (physical or virtual) with different configuration to run.

---> Pros and Cons of Selenium Grid?
Ans: CONS:
1. Setting up Selenium Grid is expensive if we require our tests to be executed
on a large number of machines with different OS+Browser combinations. In that case
we need to procure different nodes/machines with different OS+Browser combinations.
2.  Maintenance of Selenium Grid nodes and hub is very tedious. Suppose the nodes or
hub are getting shutdown or some other failures is happening then who is going to look
after it.

PROS:
1. Supports parallel testing. please note that it only supports the parallel testing
by giving infrastructure but it actually doesn't provide any capability of parallel execution.
That is given by testNG only.
2. It supports Cross browser and platform testing.
3. It supports cross browser version testing
