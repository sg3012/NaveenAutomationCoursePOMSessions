1. What are the name of the software we could use to install and configure different types of virtual machines
on a physical machine?
Ans: Hypervisor provided by company VMWare, Citrix Workspace provided by company Citrix systems etc.

2. What are pros and cons of setting up Selenium Grid using virtual machines?
Ans : PROS
1.  Maintenance overhead of Grid nodes and Hub is less.
2. We need only one physical machine/HW to configure different VMs 
for nodes and hub

CONS:
1. This architecture is still expensive.
2. We need to hire a dedicated person having expertise in VMs
    to handle issues like memory issues with nodes and hub, restart the Vms, Install and configure
    new VMs if there is a new version available, Configure hub and nodes etc.
3. This VM design is very heavy weight because we need to install full OS along with
    VM if we just need a different browser version for our tests. And these VMs consume too
    much of RAM.
