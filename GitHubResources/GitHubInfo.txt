- There are 2 sites in the Git world:
1. The local site : Which is the local machine having the code base on which you are working
2. The remote site : Which is the remote website (GitHub.com) having the code base which push to
and pull from.

- The local site is also called Workspace or working directory. Meaning the folder
  in which the whole project exists.

- [RECOMMENDED] The number of repositories on the remote site should be equal to the 
  number of projects on the local site i.e., if we have 2 projects for different products with 
  different code base in our local machines then we should have 2 Repositories on the Remote
  site for better code maintenance
  
  - The dot in the .git folder in any project means it is a hidden folder. In fact, dot
  just before the folder name means it is a hidden folder in most of the OS 
  
  - The whole project code is in the working directory ( the folder in which the whole
     project exists) until you add that code to the staging/index area using Git add
     command
    
   - The project comes under LOCAL REPO whenever you commit the code in your working
   directory.
   
   - Whenever you push a code to any branch on remote Git creates a branch with the same
   name in your local machine too for the tracking purpose
	
  - There are following statuses git uses to keep track of files:
     --> UNTRACKED - These are the files which are never committed in any of the branches
     and added in the staging area ever and pushed to github from any of the branches ever.
     
     --> TRACKED: These are the files which are added to the stage area but never committed and pushed.
     
     --> MODIFIED: These are the files which have already been pushed to the remote repo to the github once
     but now some changes have been made in the working directory in the local machine. 
     
     --> REMEMBER, when you have already added the entire code base of your project
     once in the staging area using "git add . " don't use the same command when
     you have just modified few files in your local and want to push that. If you use
     the same add command again and again even while pushing a few files it will
     add the entire code base again and again in the staging area which is not good.
     
     --> git log: This command is used to get the list of all commits till now in the local repo. 
     
     --> git log --oneline: This command is used get very brief details of all the commits
     done so far in the local repo in only one line
     
     --> The latest commit in the whole commit list in any of the branch is called the HEAD of the
     branch
  
  - We ignore the following files / folders to be pushed to the source code mgmnt. tool
  like Git by putting them in .gitignore file:
  	1. Test output folder created by testNG
  	2. allure-results folder having allure reports JSON format created by Allure Reports library
  	3. Screenshots folder created after running different test runs.
  	4. build folder created by Maven
  	5. Reports folder created by Extent Reports etc.
  	6. Some particular files/folders created by some specific text editors like
  	   .settings folder by Eclipse, out/ folder created by IntelliJ
  	7. Some particular files created by some OS like .DS_Store created by MacOSX 
  	8. All the JAR files / dependencies for different libraries
  	
  - Following are the syntaxes we use to move files and folders in .gitignore file:
    ---> To move any specific file with full file name (including extension): <filename.extension>
    ---> To move any file with a very specific file extension : <*.fileextension>, here * means any
           file having the fileextension
    ---> To move specific folder: <foldername/>
