[IMPORTANT]: You need to download the docker-compose file for selenoid docker
Grid images provided by Aerokube/Selenoid community on their official source code repository. 
Here is the URL: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium

[VERY IMPORTANT]: To change the running port for Selenoid UI use the following option:
<desired-port-number>:8080
NOTE: Make sure you MUST use the port number after colon as 8080 only. Because Selenoid UI runs
on port 8080 by default. If you use a different port after colon then Selenoid UI might
or might not run ( It may not be stable )

---> What is Selenoid?
Ans: Selenoid is a Selenium Grid infrastructure implemented on top of Docker containers technology. It is
developed by company Aerokube and written in GoLang.
It is very fast as compared to traditional Selenium Grid infrastructure.

---> To use the Selenoid Grid we need to install the browser node (chrome, firefox, opera etc.) images 
provided by Selenoid community itself. We don't need to use the browser node images 
provided by Selenium.

---> Selenoid provides one additional container named Selenoid UI apart from the hub and browser node
containers which are also provided by Traditional Selenium Grid on Docker hub. Selenoid UI
is used to visualize the running test cases in real-time

---> Apart from the docker-compose.yml file we need one additional file named browsers.json file to
configure selenoid infrastructure

---> One additional and important advantage given by Selenoid is that you can run your tests on DIFFERENT
VERSIONS (lower or higher) of your browser than the current version. 

---> [IMPORTANT]:  Make sure you don't have another service running on the same port as mentioned
in the docker-compose file for selenoid under "Selenoid UI" service. By default Selenoid UI runs on port 8080
and Jenkins also run on the same port. So, if you have Jenkins instance running on the same port
then make sure you either change the port for Jenkins or Selenoid UI service in compose file.

---> Command to create a network line in Selenoid: docker network create "<exact network-name-under
networks section of docker compose file>"

--> What are the steps to run a docker-compose file for Selenoid Grid? OR
What are the steps to pull the images and run respective containers using
docker-compose for Selenoid Grid?
Ans: 
1. First create a network line using command:
docker network create "<exact network-name-under
networks section of docker compose file>" [This is a MUST step
before issuing the up command. If the network line is not created
then up command will throw an error]

2. Next issue the command: docker-compose up -d
