--> Which AWS service is used to create machine(s) with different configurations?
Ans: Compute Service

--> We need to create some security groups to access different applications and even the AWS machines
itself under different security protocols. These security groups are often called as virtual firewalls.
Through security groups we could access selenoid grid on 4444, selenoid UI on 8080, ssh connections
for login and accessing those machine etc.
